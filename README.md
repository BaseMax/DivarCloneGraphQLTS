# Divar-Clone GraphQL TS

GraphQL-based Divar.ir Clone

Description
This project aims to create a clone of the popular Iranian classified advertisements website, Divar.ir, using GraphQL as the primary API technology. The clone will replicate the core features and functionality of Divar.ir, allowing users to post ads, browse listings, search for items, and communicate with sellers.

The project will utilize GraphQL to provide a flexible and efficient API that enables clients to query and mutate data. GraphQL offers a declarative and efficient approach to retrieve specific data requirements, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

## Features

- **Ad Posting and Management:** Users can create ads, add details such as title, description, price, location, and images, and manage their existing ads.
- **Browse Listings:** Users can view a list of available ads, sorted by category, location, or other filters.
- **Search:** Users can search for specific ads based on keywords, location, category, or other criteria.
- **Messaging:** Users can communicate with sellers through a messaging system to inquire about ads or negotiate deals.
- **Notifications:** Users will receive notifications for activities related to their ads, such as new inquiries or messages.
